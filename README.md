# Real-Time Messaging with Express

Welcome to the Real-Time Messaging with Express project! This project demonstrates how to build a real-time messaging application using Express.js, Socket.IO, and HTML.

## Overview

This project allows users to communicate with each other in real-time through a web interface. It utilizes the following technologies:

- **Express.js**: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **Socket.IO**: A library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between web clients and servers.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Front-end components for building the user interface and handling client-side logic.
